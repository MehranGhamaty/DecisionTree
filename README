Trees use Gini Index to calculate information gain for splits.

train a tree with:
  dtree::TreeNode<float , vector , vector   , vector, int  , vector> tree(Xtrain, ytrain);
                 <Number, Example, Attribute, X     , Label, Labels>
  template types are:
  Number:    type of the values in the training set (only supports numerics)
  Example:   container for an example, only used for predicting
  Attribute: could have made this the same as an example
  X:         container of Attributes
  Label:     type of labels
  Labels:    container of labels

prune a tree with:
  tree.prunetree(Xprune, yprune);

Make a prediction:
  int prediction = tree.predictexample({2,1,1});

print the tree (the if statements):
  cout << tree;
  
Tested with gcc 6.3.1

A slightly incorrect way of using templates. Not going to explain way, but here we are.
