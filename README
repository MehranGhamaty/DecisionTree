The gini score is the criteria for generating splits. 

Train a tree with:
  dtree::TreeNode<float , vector , vector   , vector, int  , vector> tree(Xtrain, ytrain);
                 <Number, Example, Attribute, X     , Label, Labels>
  template types are:
  Number:    Type of the values in the training set (only supports numerics)
  Example:   Structure for an example for predicting
  Attribute: Mirror the example
  X:         Structure of Attributes
  Label:     Type of labels
  Labels:    Structure for the labels

prune a tree with:
  tree.prunetree(Xprune, yprune);

Make a prediction:
  int prediction = tree.predictexample({2,1,1});

print the tree (the if statements):
  cout << tree;
  
Tested with gcc 6.3.1
